## Prerequisite 

> For the script to run successfully it is necessary for there to be **at least one episode manually published** on Anchor.fm. The steps to publish on a brand new Anchor.fm account are different and will break the automation.

1. Make sure you have `node`, `npm` and `git` installed on your machine.

   ```bash
    node --version && npm --version && git --version
   ```
## Setting up automation

### (Once) Set up Github Credentials

> If you are not using any `GCM (Git Credential Manager)` which already has `Personal Access Token` to authenticate you with Github, do the following steps. Otherwise, skip.

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
2. Install [Github CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation)
3. Make `gh` your credential manager  
   ```
      gh auth setup-git
   ```
4. Run the following to setup credentials. For help [gh auth login](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_auth_login)
   ```bash
      gh auth login
   ``` 

### (Everytime) Creating a new podcast

#### On Github.com

1. On [Github](github.com) 
   1. Create `new branch from local-cron` and name it like `podcast_1`. 
2. Go to secrets and create `ANCHOR_EMAIL_1` and `ANCHOR_PASSWORD_1`. 
    > The `_x` naming format are important to match branch to podcast credentials.

#### On your local machine 

1. Open a terminal
2. If first time, on your local machine create a folder and navigate into the folder before proceeding, as this is where all subsequent podcast branches should be placed.
   1. `mkdir podcasts && cd podcasts/`
3. Clone the `podcast_x` repository to a folder in your local machine and navigate into the folder.
    ```bash
      git clone -b <podcast_x> <repository_url> <podcast_x>
    ```
    eg.
    ```
    replace `<podcast_x>` with your new podcast branch eg. podcast_2
    replace `<repository_url>` with your repository url eg. https://github.com/username/repo.git
    git clone -b podcast_2 https://github.com/username/repo.git podcast_2
    ```
5. Change into the new `podcast_x` directory.

### Setting up the cron job

#### Playlist

1. To attach a Playlist URL to this branch ( this will be used in all subsequent runs )
    ```bash
      ./scripts/prompt-url.sh
    ```
#### Setup Workflow

1. To update the github action to match Anchor password and email
    ```bash
      ./scripts/update-workflow.sh
    ```
#### Setup Cron

1.  To set the job to run at a specific time.
    1.  To cron the job 
        ```bash
          ./scripts/cron-it.sh
        ``` 
    2. The job runs every Thursday at 12 pm your machine's local time, the machine needs to be powered on at this hour. To change the timings see next section.

#### Edit Cron Job Timing

1. At times, you would want to edit the cronjob, use `crontab -e` and edit it. [Cronguru](https://crontab.guru/) can help you in figuring out the format used in timing a job.

2. To check if the cron job is set, you can list it using
    ```bash
     crontab -l
    ```

### See Your Actions

1. On [Github](https://github.com) go to a `podcast branch` and under `Actions` tab you check status of your workflows.

### Rerun failed Actions

1. On your local machine using terminal, navigate into a branch, eg. podcast_1
2. Run the following command
  ```
  ./scripts/see-failed.sh
  ```
## Manual Method

The manual method is still available from `main` branch and using a `codespace`, same as before. If it is ever needed.

## How is the converted videos data stored ?

For first run the `convertedVideos.json` file should have the following keys. 

```json
{
    "name": "Upload processed data",
    "videoQuantity": 0,
    "lastUpdated": "",
    "videos": []
}
```

- The video information is stored in the key `videos` as array of _video IDs_

## Concern regarding automation of playlists

> **NOTE:** Automation depends on this [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fabricio-191/youtube) to fetch playlist related information without use of an API key.

> **Warning:** There might be concerns regarding violation of Github TOS when it comes to uploading of a playlist. [Read more here](https://github.com/Schrodinger-Hat/youtube-to-anchorfm#how-to-upload-a-youtube-playlist-to-anchorfm-using-this-script)

> **Manual Effort:** At times some fields don't get populated on AnchorFM (eg. title being untitled), this is dependent on Github Action and will need manual intervention.

> **Limitation:** Github allows for 2000 min of action usage per month. Once you run out of these get an account or wait for next month.

<!-- ### Processing a playlist

> Using an example [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABbDB6xri8o&list=PLrAXtmErZgOcl7mvyfkQTHFnOGZxWtN55)

- To process all of them do as recommened [here](https://github.com/Schrodinger-Hat/youtube-to-anchorfm#how-to-upload-a-youtube-playlist-to-anchorfm-using-this-script) 

https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md

Homebrew seems to be having some problem with their installation script, more like their repositories are having issues.
Or may be it is Github's issue nonetheless curl timesout
