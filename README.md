# Automating youtube video to anchor fm audio

## TODO

- [x] Comparision script that pops converted episodes
- [ ] A file that tracks already converted episodes
- [ ] Script to execute push trigger for workflow on episodes
- [ ] Add conversion date to already uploaded episode object at the end of workflow run success


> For the script to run successfully its necessary for there to be at least one episode manually published on Anchor.fm, as the steps to publish on a brand new Anchor.fm account are different, and the automation will break.

- Automation depends on the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fabricio-191/youtube) to fetch playlist related information.
    - In workflow yaml add YT_PLAYLIST environment variable to URL of youtube playlist.
      ```yaml
      env:
        YT_PLAYLIST: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABbDB6xri8o&list=PLrAXtmErZgOcl7mvyfkQTHFnOGZxWtN55
      ```
- Go to `Settings -> Secrets -> New Repository Secret`
    - Add the following one by one
        - ANCHOR_EMAIL `your email id on anchor`
        - ANCHOR_PASSWORD `your anchor account password`
